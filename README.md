## WHAT
Trailblazer is an app for anyone who enjoys walking or hiking the world's open trails. Here you can explore and contribute to a collection of trails around the world.

## WHY
I am a nature lover, tree hugger, and feel the most at ease and comforted when walking one of nature's trails. So, I thought, what better way to show that love and appreciation than through an app dedicated the just that.

## USER STORY
As a user, I want to be able to add a new trail to the database, so that I can reference it and other users will be able to find said trail. <br>
As a user, I want to be able to view all trails in the database, regardless of location, so that I can browse trails in other areas. <br>
As a user, I want to be able to view a specific trail when I click its name, so that I can see the location and length of the trail. <br>
As a user, I want to have the ability to update trail information or delete a trail from the database, so that the data is current and up to date.
